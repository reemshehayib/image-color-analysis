# Color Analysis
This API will help in retrieving color data about your image.  
Data include the color ration in the image.  
You can choose the color you want to study or process in RBG criteria.  
The API will look like this:

  
<img width="944" alt="image" src="https://github.com/reemshehayib/image-color-analysis/assets/82656744/86db4d10-23cd-4f21-958c-974c89d4311e">


## Notes:  
- Include your image's full directory if you're using Linux, or include your image in the project's directory if you're using Windows.
- The color_HSV.json file includes both the upper and lower range of the colors in HSV format, so make sure if adjusting to include both ranges for the image to be processed.
